# Background: Met with Dr. Jantrania on 6/11/24 and was assigned this project of automating data management in this research spreadsheet which I properly began 6/13/24 (was awaiting laptop)

# 6/14/24

Sheet 1 (Data Analyzed) fucntionality, Program can now autogenerate new row averages of all of the month's values. 
GitHub for documentation and access to files was created and will be update once the final version of the first iteration of this code is deemed ready.

- To be added/next steps:
    1. Proper/extensive testing of sheet 1 (Data Analyzed) Functionality
    2. Auto generation of charts on sheet 2 (Charts)

- Side notes/Requirements to be addressed: include steps to select VBA references just in case, no spaces in file name, keep format used for dates in averages section, must update monthly since it uses the date on your computer

# 6/17/24

- Finalized update on charts (testing functionality complete)

- Opted for a simple custom ribbon for the UI

- Began auto generation of charts on sheet 2 (Charts)

- Decided to only include an update all button (Dr. Jantrania's main priority is click and done so decided against variability of updating specific things)

# 6/18/24 + 6/19/24

- New bugs were found and fixed (data from different dates mixed in with needed data, updating final averages, type mismatches)

- Moving on: waiting for response on what to do with seemingly unneeded charts on sheet 2 and sheet 4. Next sheet to complete at the moment is sheet 3

- Will also implement a way to switch/generate charts with different sets of data/different time ranges etc. (Last on list)

# 6/20/24

- Meeting

# 6/26/24 + 6/27/24

- Lots of work done essentially complete, as of now all thats left updating github/documentation

- Finalized Graph/Chart automation and hence finished program
